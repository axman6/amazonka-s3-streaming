{- |
Given a 'CreateMultipartUpload', creates a 'Sink' which will sequentially
upload the data streamed in in chunks of at least 'chunkSize' and return
the 'CompleteMultipartUploadResponse'.

If uploading of any parts fails, an attempt is made to abort the Multipart
upload, but it is likely that if an upload fails this abort may also fail.
'Network.AWS.S3.ListMultipartUploads' can be used to list any pending
uploads - it is important to abort multipart uploads because you will
be charged for storage of the parts until it is completed or aborted.
See the AWS documentation for more details.

May throw 'Network.AWS.Error'

{-|
Allows a file or 'ByteString' to be uploaded concurrently, using the
async library.  The chunk size may optionally be specified, but will be at least
`minimumChunkSize`, and may be made larger than if the `ByteString` or file
is larger enough to cause more than 10,000 chunks.

Files are mmapped into 'chunkSize' chunks and each chunk is uploaded in parallel.
This considerably reduces the memory necessary compared to reading the contents
into memory as a strict 'ByteString'. The usual caveats about mmaped files apply:
if the file is modified during this operation, the data may become corrupt.

May throw `Network.AWS.Error`, or `IOError`; an attempt is made to cancel the
multipart upload on any error, but this may also fail if, for example, the network
connection has been broken. See `abortAllUploads` for a crude cleanup method.
